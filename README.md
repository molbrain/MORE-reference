# MORE-reference

The reference files and data are prepared for the MORE (Mobile-elements Originated Reads Enrichment) methods for sequencing data analysis. These files are available on bulk RNA-seq, WGS/WES, ChIP-seq, scRNA-seq, long-read sequencing analysis, etc. Of course, any other all kinds of analysis than sequencing are also OK.
